## üåü Advanced Features

### Historical Tracking

The enhanced version automatically tracks changes over time:

- **Score Changes**: Monitors when file scores change
- **Library Trends**: Tracks overall library health improvements
- **Upgrade Tracking**: Records when files are upgraded
- **Format Adoption**: Monitors new custom format usage

### Intelligent Analysis

#### Upgrade Candidate Detection

The system identifies files that would benefit from upgrades based on:

1. **Score Threshold**: Files below your configured threshold
2. **Negative Formats**: Files with formats that subtract points
3. **Missing High-Value Formats**: Files lacking beneficial formats
4. **Quality Inconsistencies**: Files that don't match profile expectations

#### Custom Format Effectiveness

Analyzes which TRaSH Guides formats provide the most value:

- **Usage Frequency**: How often each format appears
- **Score Contribution**: Average score impact per format
- **ROI Analysis**: Value vs. storage cost for each format
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Suggestions for format configuration

#### Quality Profile Performance

Compares your quality profiles:

- **Score Distribution**: How files perform within each profile
- **Effectiveness Rating**: A-F grades for each profile
- **Usage Statistics**: Which profiles are most/least used
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommendations for profile improvements

### Database Features

The SQLite database provides:

```bash
# Check database status
sqlite3 ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM media_files;"

# View recent changes
sqlite3 ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db "
  SELECT timestamp, change_type, file_id, old_score, new_score 
  FROM score_history 
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
  LIMIT 10;
"

# Library statistics
sqlite3 ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db "
  SELECT 
    service_type,
    COUNT(*) as total_files,
    AVG(total_score) as avg_score,
    MIN(total_score) as min_score,
    MAX(total_score) as max_score
  FROM media_files 
  GROUP BY service_type;
"
```

## üîç Analysis Interpretation

### Understanding Scores

**Positive Scores (+):**
- Indicate desirable qualities (Remux, HDR, high bitrates)
- Higher positive scores = better quality

**Negative Scores (-):**
- Indicate undesirable qualities (Cam, TS, low quality)
- More negative scores = lower quality

**Zero Scores (0):**
- Neutral or unmatched formats
- Common for standard releases

### Priority Levels

**Priority 1 (Critical):**
- Files with significantly negative scores
- Immediate attention recommended
- Often containing harmful formats (Cam, TS)

**Priority 2 (High):**
- Files well below library average
- Should be upgraded when possible
- Missing key quality indicators

**Priority 3 (Medium):**
- Files slightly below optimal
- Upgrade when convenient
- Minor quality improvements available

**Priority 4 (Low):**
- Files near or above average
- Upgrade only if storage allows
- Minimal quality improvements

### Health Grades

- **A (90-100)**: Excellent library with mostly high-quality files
- **B (80-89)**: Good library with some optimization opportunities
- **C (70-79)**: Average library needing moderate improvements
- **D (60-69)**: Below average library requiring attention
- **F (<60)**: Poor library needing significant improvements

## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimization

### System-Specific Tuning

**Small Libraries (<1,000 files):**
```yaml
export:
  max_workers: 3
  retry_attempts: 3
  timeout: 30
```

**Medium Libraries (1,000-5,000 files):**
```yaml
export:
  max_workers: 5
  retry_attempts: 3
  timeout: 45
```

**Large Libraries (5,000+ files):**
```yaml
export:
  max_workers: 3          # Reduce to avoid overwhelming *Arr
  retry_attempts: 5       # More retries for reliability
  timeout: 60             # Longer timeout for large requests
```

**Fast Systems/Networks:**
```yaml
export:
  max_workers: 8          # Increase parallelism
  retry_delay: 0.5        # Faster retry cycles
  timeout: 20             # Shorter timeout for fast responses
```

### Memory Management

Monitor memory usage during exports:

```bash
# Monitor memory usage (Linux/macOS)
top -p $(pgrep -f arr-export)

# Check available memory
free -h

# Windows Task Manager or PowerShell
Get-Process -Name python | Select-Object ProcessName, WorkingSet
```

If experiencing memory issues:
1. Reduce `max_workers` to 2-3
2. Close other applications during export
3. Consider upgrading system RAM
4. Run exports during off-peak hours

### Network Optimization

For slow or unreliable networks:

```yaml
export:
  max_workers: 2          # Reduce concurrent requests
  retry_attempts: 5       # More retries for reliability
  retry_delay: 2          # Longer delays between retries
  timeout: 120            # Extended timeout for slow responses
```

## üöë Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Configuration Issues

**"No configuration file found"**
```bash
# Solution: Create configuration file
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your details
```

**"Invalid YAML syntax"**
```bash
# Solution: Validate YAML syntax
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config.yaml'))"
```

#### Connection Issues

**"Connection refused"**
1. Verify *Arr services are running
2. Check URLs in configuration
3. Test manual connection:
```bash
curl "http://your-radarr:7878/api/v3/system/status" -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_KEY"
```

**"401 Unauthorized"**
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check API key hasn't expired
3. Ensure no extra spaces in configuration

#### Performance Issues

**"Export taking too long"**
1. Reduce `max_workers` in configuration
2. Check network connectivity to *Arr services
3. Monitor system resources during export

**"High memory usage"**
1. Reduce `max_workers` to 2-3
2. Close other applications
3. Consider system upgrade for large libraries

#### Database Issues

**"Database is locked"** (Fixed in v2.0)
This issue was resolved with enhanced connection management. If you still encounter it:
1. Ensure no other processes are accessing the database
2. Check file permissions on database directory
3. Try restarting the export

### Advanced Diagnostics

#### System Health Check
```bash
# Test everything
arr-export test-config

# Check Python environment
python --version
pip list | grep -E "(click|rich|requests|sqlite)"

# Verify file permissions
ls -la ~/.arr-score-exporter/
ls -la exports/
```

#### Network Diagnostics
```bash
# Test network connectivity
ping your-radarr-hostname
telnet your-radarr-hostname 7878

# Test API endpoints
curl -v "http://your-radarr:7878/api/v3/system/status" -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_KEY"
```

#### Database Diagnostics
```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Check database size and tables
ls -lh ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db
sqlite3 ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db ".tables"

# Check record counts
sqlite3 ~/.arr-score-exporter/library.db "
  SELECT 
    'media_files' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records 
  FROM media_files
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'score_history' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records 
  FROM score_history
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'export_runs' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records 
  FROM export_runs;
"
```

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Enable verbose logging**:
   ```bash
   arr-export --verbose radarr > debug.log 2>&1
   ```

2. **Check the troubleshooting guide**: [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

3. **Create an issue** on GitHub with:
   - Your configuration (remove API keys)
   - Error messages
   - System information
   - Debug log output

## üéØ Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance

1. **Weekly Exports**: Run exports weekly to track improvements
2. **Monitor Trends**: Check dashboard trends for library health
3. **Database Cleanup**: Occasionally check database size and clean old data
4. **Configuration Updates**: Keep TRaSH Guides formats updated

### Optimization Workflow

1. **Initial Export**: Get baseline library health score
2. **Identify Priorities**: Focus on Priority 1 and 2 upgrade candidates
3. **Implement Changes**: Upgrade files or adjust quality profiles
4. **Track Progress**: Run regular exports to monitor improvements
5. **Fine-tune**: Adjust custom format scores based on analysis

### Production Deployment

For automated environments:

```bash
# Cron job for daily exports
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/arr-score-exporter && arr-export both

# Docker deployment
docker run -v /config:/config -v /data:/data arr-score-exporter:latest arr-export both

# Kubernetes CronJob
# See docs/API_REFERENCE.md for complete Kubernetes examples
```
